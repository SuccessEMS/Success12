        <h1 class="mt-export-title">Editing a Booking in the Navigator</h1>
        <p class="Body">When you edit a booking in the Navigator, you are working with the <em>when</em> and <em>where</em> information for the event: the event time, the event location, and so on. To edit a booking, you must have the appropriate security access. For example, you cannot move a booking to a room if your EMS administrator has not granted you access to the room. Likewise, you cannot change the status for a booking from Tentative to Confirmed if your EMS administrator has not granted you access to the Confirmed status.</p>
