MadCap:editor="Megan.Laub" MadCap:editDate="2017-11-11T17:05:31.6442424-07:00">Reservation</MadCap:annotation> Using the Reservation Wizard</h1>
        <p class="Body">You use the Reservation Wizard to check for available space and to make a reservation for the event, &#160;for a particular time on one day (a simple reservation with one booking) or on multiple days (a series reservation with multiple bookings). You can also create a series reservation by selecting one date and time, but multiple rooms. This topic guides you in using this tool.&#160;</p>
        <p class="note-box"><strong>Note:&#160;</strong>The following procedure describes how to make a reservation by selecting values for required and optional fields.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If your EMS administrator has configured reservation wizard templates, then a Reservation Wizard Template dropdown list is displayed at the top of the Reservation Wizard. You can start making&#160;a reservation in the Reservation Wizard by selecting a template, which automatically sets default values for many of the fields in the Reservation Wizard.</li>
            <li>If your job entails making multiple reservations that require the same information, and you are not using reservation wizard templates, you can set your own default values for many of the fields in the Reservation Wizard. See <a title="Setting User Preferences and Default Values">Setting User</a><a title="Setting User Preferences and Default Values"> Preferences and Default Values</a>.</li>

            <li>If needed, use the scroll buttons on the top of the Calendar to see a different month (&lt; or &gt;) or for a different year (&lt;&lt; or &gt;&gt;). You can also click the month name or&#160;year at the top of the calendar to choose a different month or year.</li>
            <li>If the event dates do <em>not</em> follow a pattern, use one or more of the following options for entering a date; otherwise, go to Step 4.</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>Click on the dates on the calendar that the event is to take place.</li>
            <li>To select all five days in a work week, click in the blank space that is to the left of the week.</li>
            <li>To select all seven days in a week, double-click in the blank space that is to the left of the week.</li>
        </ul>

            <li>To select every occurrence of a specific day of the week that is currently displayed onscreen (regardless if the day falls within the same month), double-click the heading (S, M, T, and so on) for the day.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note-box">Tip:&#160;If you need to clear a single selected date, click the date again. To clear multiple selected dates in a single step, click Clear Month to clear all currently selected dates for the currently displayed month or click Clear All to clear all currently selected dates regardless of month or year.</p>
        <ol start="4">
            <li>If the event dates <em>do</em> follow a pattern, (for example, the third Friday of every month), click <strong>Date Pattern</strong> to&#160;enter your event date information.</li>

        </p>
        <p class="note-box"><strong>Tip:&#160;</strong>Creating&#160;a date pattern in EMS is very similar to the steps used in Microsoft Outlook<sup>®</sup> or in any other calendaring product. As you specify the event dates, the following occurs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Selected Dates tab is automatically updated with the selected dates.</li>
            <li>If your EMS administrator has configured any of the dates that you selected as a holiday or as closed, messages display indicating this.</li>
            <li>Closed dates are&#160;red on the Calendar tab and linked to information about the closure. Holidays are green&#160;linked to information about the holiday.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="StepResultNoBullet">For any date, after you select the date on the Calendar tab, you can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Toggle between the Calendar tab and the Selected Date tab. Open the Selected Dates tab, select the date, and then click <strong>Go To Date</strong>.</li>
            <li>Remove the date from the list of selected dates. Open the Selected Dates tab, select the date, or CTRL-click to select multiple dates, and then click <strong>Remove</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note-box"><strong>Tip:  </strong>When you make a reservation for multiple dates, the process is easier if you first remove all holidays or closed dates from the list of selected dates; however, be very careful when selecting dates for removal as you are not prompted to confirm your selection before you click <strong>Remove</strong>.</p>
        <p class="StepResultNoBullet">You can click on closed or holiday dates to see more information, as shown in the example below.</p>
        <p class="AnchorFigure">
            <img border="0" class="internal" />
        </p>
        <p class="StepResultNoBullet">In addition, for holidays, you can view information about the date from the Selected Dates tab: open the Selected Dates tab, scroll to and select the date, and then click Holidays.</p>
        <h2><a name="RTF32343531353a20486561644c"></a>Setting the Event Time and Status</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Do one of the following to specify the start time and end time for the event:</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>Select a time from the dropdown list for each field.</li>
            <li>Manually enter the time in each field.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note-box"><strong>Tip:  </strong>When you manually enter the time, you can use a shortcut. For example, for 9:00 am, you need to enter only "9a" and for 2:00 pm, you need to enter only "2p," and so on. If you enter an end time that is earlier than the start time, then the system assumes that the end time is the next day and the phrase "Next Day" is displayed to the right of the<strong> End time</strong> field.</p>
        <ol start="2">
            <li>Do one of the following to specify the Setup and Teardown times.</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>To use the default setup and teardown times that your EMS administrator has assigned to the rooms in your system, leave <strong>Use Default</strong> selected.</li>
            <li>To override the default setup/teardown times, clear <strong>Use Default</strong>, select <strong>Minutes </strong>or <strong>Hours</strong>, and then enter your own setup and teardown times.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note-box"><strong>Tip:&#160;</strong>Remember, setup and teardown times are the hours, or fractions of hours, that you add to the event time to allow staff to prepare a room for the event or to clean up after the event. For example, for a 30 minute setup time, you can enter 30 minutes or 0.5 hours.</p>
        <ol start="3">
            <li>Select the <strong>Status </strong>for the event. Depending on the status that you select, for example, Tentative or Hold, you may be required to enter a reconfirm date. You can monitor reservations that must be reconfirmed on the Reconfirm Dates tab on the EMS Dashboard. <strong>See Also</strong>:&#160;<a title="EMS Dashboard">EMS Dashboard</a>.</li>

        <h2>Searching For a Specific Room</h2>
        <p class="Body">You can use the specific room search to book a standard EMS room or a room or area that is not managed in EMS. An <em>override room</em>, or "override description," is used to book an event in a space that has not been configured in your EMS  system. For example, your EMS administrator might have configured an override room named "Other Area" in the Engineering building. To book an event in Dr. Wilson's office, which is a room that is not defined in EMS, in the Engineering building, you can select the "Other Area" room and specify "Dr. Wilson's Office" for the location. EMS  does not track availability for events booked in override rooms; however, EMS  reports on events that are scheduled in an override room just like any other event scheduled for any other room.</p>
